# Customer-behavior-analysis-in-e-commerce


This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior within an e-commerce platform using various data visualization techniques. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas and Plotly, we can derive insights into customer engagement, demographics, and purchasing patterns. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key analyses performed:

1. Data Overview: 
   - Loaded and reviewed the e-commerce customer dataset.
   - Displayed summary statistics to understand the distribution of numeric features.

2. Age Distribution:
   - Created a histogram to visualize the age distribution of customers, helping to identify key age demographics.

3. Gender Distribution:
   - Generated a bar chart to illustrate the distribution of genders among customers, offering insights into gender-based customer proportions.

4. Browsing Time vs. Pages Viewed:
   - Plotted a scatter plot to examine the relationship between product browsing time and the total number of pages viewed, with a trendline to highlight any significant trends.

5. Grouped Analysis:
   - Analyzed the average total pages viewed by gender and device type, visualizing these metrics with bar charts to identify differences in browsing behavior.

6. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Segmentation:
   - Calculated the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and segmented customers into 'Low Value', 'Medium Value', and 'High Value' categories based on CLV. Visualized the distribution of these segments in a bar chart to understand the customer base's value distribution.

7. Funnel Analysis:
   - Conducted a funnel analysis to track the conversion process from product browsing to items added to the cart and total purchases. This analysis helps in understanding where potential customers drop off in the conversion process.

8. Churn Rate Calculation:
   - Computed the churn rate by identifying customers with zero total purchases, providing insights into customer retention and potential areas for improvement.

This analysis aims to uncover patterns in customer behavior, providing actionable insights to enhance marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and optimize the overall shopping experience.
